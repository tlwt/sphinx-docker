## Why this tool
writing documentation is usually a pain, as it is usually done outside the development environment. We might need to switch to some wiki or other tool and loose focus.

This is where [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) comes into play. Sphinx is a documentation generator. Based on plain text files like markdown or rst it generates beautiful and searchable HTML as well as PDF documents.

But setting up sphinx can be a bit of a pain. Moving it to a docker environment is the most logical step.
