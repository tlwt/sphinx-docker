# How to write documentation

There are two options available.

## Markdown / commonmark (.md)

Markdown a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet. It was developed in 2004 and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages. But the specified syntax is not unambiguous. Thus commonmark was created.


## reStructuredText (.rst)

reStructuredText (shortly ReST, reST or RST) is a simplified markup language with the aim of being particularly readable in pure text form. Furthermore, reStructuredText should be easily convertible into other formats.
